Kite - Analysis tool enabled wireless networks.

.SH SYNOPSIS

       [-v] [--no-xml]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Kite is an open source tool to facilitate auditing of wireless
 networks that utilize the Extensible Authentication Protocol framework
for authentication.  It is meant to give useful information relating to
 the security of these networks for pentesters to use while searching for
vulnerabilities.  The output of Kite is a summary of the available 
networks, which BSSIDs are broadcasting them, and what clients are
 associated with them.  The networks are organized based on SSID and if 
no SSID is available they are marked as UNKNOWN_SSID with the 
corresponding BSSID.  Each network is also shown with any clients that 
have been associated with it and the EAP type(s) that the client seems 
to support.
